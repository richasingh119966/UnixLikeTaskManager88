# Task Manager API

A simple Flask-based task manager that mimics Unix-style commands like `ls` (list) and `fork` (create task). Tasks are created, listed, and deleted using RESTful API endpoints — plus a clean HTML UI for interaction.

---

## Features

- Create a new task (like `fork`)
- List all tasks (like `ls`)
- Delete tasks
- Simple HTML interface with buttons
- JSON-based backend storage

---

## Technolgy

- Python 3
- Flask
- JSON for storage (no database)
- HTML (for frontend)
